# Learning Taipo

I wanted to learn to type with Taipo, and as I didn't find any resources for this, decided to make
my own.  This project is very simple.

There are two initial lessons designed to each all of the letters.

Probably the most challenging part of learning Taipo is learning to alternate hands when using the
symmetric layout.  The first few lessons focus on this (starting with just a single letter).  I
found it helpful to speak out "left", "right" out loud while typing.  It didn't take long for this
to start to become automatic.
